Look at DSC 505 and determine if the class is online?
If the question is a yes or no question, only answer 'yes' or 'no'. If it is a count or recall question, answer with only the exact number or the exact answer. Do not include any punctuation, explanations, or extra words — just the direct answer.

For recall questions that require listing course sections with times and days, format exactly like this:
Sec 1, tr, 8:00am to 9:15am, Sec 2, mwf, 8:00am to 8:50am, Sec 3, mwf, 9:00am to 9:50am
No extra punctuation, no 'and', no trailing periods.

For recall questions that require listing names, use the professor's full name exactly as displayed in the dataset, in the same order they appear. Separate names with a comma and a space, like this:
Jane Doe, Jack H. Ryan, Beth Stevens
Do not reorder, reformat, or add extra text of any kind.","Given the following dataset about EasternCT course times, we know if a class is labeled as online then it has no physical room.",Look at DSC 505 and determine if the class is online?,intermediateFiles/Test8Spring2025_Instructor_Course_Schedule_2025-05-07.csv,"If the question is a yes or no question, only answer 'yes' or 'no'.

Given it is 3pm on monday, determine if Dr. Dancik is available to meet?
If the question is a yes or no question, only answer 'yes' or 'no'. If it is a count or recall question, answer with only the exact number or the exact answer. Do not include any punctuation, explanations, or extra words — just the direct answer.

For recall questions that require listing course sections with times and days, format exactly like this:
Sec 1, tr, 8:00am to 9:15am, Sec 2, mwf, 8:00am to 8:50am, Sec 3, mwf, 9:00am to 9:50am
No extra punctuation, no 'and', no trailing periods.

For recall questions that require listing names, use the professor's full name exactly as displayed in the dataset, in the same order they appear. Separate names with a comma and a space, like this:
Jane Doe, Jack H. Ryan, Beth Stevens
Do not reorder, reformat, or add extra text of any kind.","Given the following dataset about EasternCT faculty office hours, we know that a professor is available to meet if they have office hours.","Given it is 3pm on monday, determine if Dr. Dancik is available to meet?",intermediateFiles/6TestSpring2025_Exclusive_Hours_2025-05-07.csv,"If the question is a yes or no question, only answer 'yes' or 'no'.

Looking at ART 327 Sec 1, determine if the class will take place on monday.
If the question is a yes or no question, only answer 'yes' or 'no'. If it is a count or recall question, answer with only the exact number or the exact answer. Do not include any punctuation, explanations, or extra words — just the direct answer.

For recall questions that require listing course sections with times and days, format exactly like this:
Sec 1, tr, 8:00am to 9:15am, Sec 2, mwf, 8:00am to 8:50am, Sec 3, mwf, 9:00am to 9:50am
No extra punctuation, no 'and', no trailing periods.

For recall questions that require listing names, use the professor's full name exactly as displayed in the dataset, in the same order they appear. Separate names with a comma and a space, like this:
Jane Doe, Jack H. Ryan, Beth Stevens

Given it is 12:30pm on friday, determine if Dr. Connolly is avaiable to meet?
If the question is a yes or no question, only answer 'yes' or 'no'. If it is a count or recall question, answer with only the exact number or the exact answer. Do not include any punctuation, explanations, or extra words — just the direct answer.

For recall questions that require listing course sections with times and days, format exactly like this:
Sec 1, tr, 8:00am to 9:15am, Sec 2, mwf, 8:00am to 8:50am, Sec 3, mwf, 9:00am to 9:50am
No extra punctuation, no 'and', no trailing periods.

For recall questions that require listing names, use the professor's full name exactly as displayed in the dataset, in the same order they appear. Separate names with a comma and a space, like this:
Jane Doe, Jack H. Ryan, Beth Stevens
Do not reorder, reformat, or add extra text of any kind.","Looking at the following dataset below about EasternCT faculty office hours, we know that a professor is available to meet if they have office hours.","Given it is 12:30pm on friday, determine if Dr. Connolly is avaiable to meet?",intermediateFiles/6TestSpring2025_Exclusive_Hours_2025-05-07.csv,"If the question is a yes or no question, only answer 'yes' or 'no'.
